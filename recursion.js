// Returns true when a number is even, false when a number is odd
// Uses recursion based on the following rules:
// Zero is even
// One is odd
// For any number N, it's evenness is the same as N-2
//
// To handle negative numbers, converts them to positive numbers.

function isEven(x) {
  var num = Math.abs(x); //handle negative numbers

  // Check to see if the value is zero or one and returns corresponing response
  // Otherwise performs a recursion after subtracting two.
}
